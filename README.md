# VFiX

Fixes various visual and audio issues introduced by Seekers of the Storm. Clientside.

### Timings
Fixes most cases of effects randomly disappearing before they're supposed to end.

### Effect positions
Fixes some visual effects not properly attaching to objects theyre supposed to, causing them to float where they spawn and not follow an object.

Notable examples:
* Preon charge effect
* Clay Templar death effect
* Golem death effect

### Missing effects
Fixes missing visuals for chest open animations.

Fixes interactable outlines randomly not appearing.

### Sound
Fixes some impact sounds sometimes re-playing after a delay.

Fixes effects sometimes not playing sound.

Fixes missing hit sound for Royal Capacitor and Charged Perforator.
